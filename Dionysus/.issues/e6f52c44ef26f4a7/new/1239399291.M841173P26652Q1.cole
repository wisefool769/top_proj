Subject: Intrusive containers for ZigzagPersistence
Message-Id: <e6f52c44ef26f4a7-0-artemis@cole>
category: efficiency

Use Boost's intrusive containers to store rows in ZigzagPersistence. This
should get rid of the inefficiencies associated with the simplex removal
(through ZigzagPersistence::remove()).
